 The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that are widely used in object-oriented software development. They were coined by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) and are considered to be fundamental guidelines for writing maintainable and flexible code. The SOLID acronym stands for the following principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or purpose. By adhering to SRP, each class becomes focused and easier to understand, test, and maintain. It promotes high cohesion and reduces coupling between classes.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its existing code. This is typically achieved by using abstraction and interfaces, allowing you to add new functionality by adding new classes instead of modifying existing ones.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, if a program is using a base class, it should still work correctly if an instance of any derived class is used instead. This principle ensures that inheritance hierarchies are well-designed and that subclasses do not introduce unexpected behavior or violate contracts defined by the superclass.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It promotes the idea of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose interfaces. By adhering to ISP, you avoid the problem of classes being forced to implement methods that are irrelevant to their functionality, thus reducing the potential for coupling and making the system more maintainable.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. In other words, the principle promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define the interactions between different components of a system. This allows for loose coupling between modules and facilitates easier changes and substitutions of implementations.
