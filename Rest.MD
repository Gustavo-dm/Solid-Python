REST APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are interfaces that adhere to the principles of REST. They enable communication between different software systems over a network, typically the internet. REST APIs allow clients (such as web applications, mobile apps, or other services) to interact with a server by sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses.

RESTful, on the other hand, refers to systems or APIs that follow the principles of REST. It implies that the API is designed and implemented in a way that aligns with the core principles of REST. The term "RESTful" is often used to describe APIs that are well-designed, scalable, and conform to REST constraints.

The key principles of REST include:

Stateless Communication: The server does not store any client state. Each request from the client must contain all the necessary information needed to understand and process it.

Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server handles data storage, processing, and other backend functionality.

Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a consistent and standardized interface, typically based on HTTP. This includes the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for specific operations, and resources are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

Resource-Oriented: REST treats resources (e.g., data entities) as the fundamental unit of the API. Each resource has a unique URI, and clients can interact with these resources by sending requests to their corresponding URIs.

State Transfer: Clients interact with resources through representations, which can be in various formats like JSON or XML. The server transfers the current state of a resource to the client in the response, and the client can manipulate or modify that state through subsequent requests.
